    "I have created this project to generate and test Python code based on natural language queries. It uses Microsoft's AutoGen framework to manage two agents: one for generating code and another for executing and validating it. The system leverages LM Studio to host Hugging Face models like Llama-2 locally, ensuring fast and secure processing.The main workflow includes 2 agents interacting with each other, generating(llama-3.2-1b-instruct) and debugging code. One agent uses Llm to generate code from natural language and other executes it and gives feedback (user can also give feedback) to the code writer generator and this conversation moves accordingly. The generated code is and all outputs, are saved in a text file for reference.\n",
    "To set up, the project requires installing the AutoGen framework, configuring LM Studio, and hosting the desired model locally. Users can run the system via a Jupyter notebook or the main script.\n",
    "Moreover, 2 use case is included with all the interactions in usecase directory."
